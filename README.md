# AI-LLM-Driven NPC Generation: A Virtual Village Simulation

This project explores the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and game development by creating a virtual village with realistic non-player characters (NPCs). Leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-turbo, we generate NPCs that autonomously interact and simulate human-like behaviors. Techniques in prompt engineering fine-tune the interactions and decision-making processes of these agents.

The architecture is divided into a back-end and a front-end. The back-end handles NPC behavior logic, including memory management, emotional responses, and interactions, inspired by neuroscience principles. The front-end, developed with Pygame and Tiled, visualizes the village and NPC interactions in real-time.
